## Tutorial:
1. First step choose the workstation thats geared more towards content creation

2. Choose the base model, remember the recomended specs in the PC parts page

3. Choose the ryzen core because its just as good as the intel core while being $35 cheaper

4. When you make it to the core components look at the ryzen processors and choose the 8 core option as that is the recomended amount of processors

5. Stick with the base motherboard chip as it contains all the spec needed for all the core parts such as the RAM chip, GPU, and the CPU

6. Choose the RAM chip with 32GB of memory as that is the recomended amount

7. When choosing a GPU you'll recall the recomended resolution is 4k which is measured by the horizontal pixels. You'll see the cheapest GPU has 5000 horizontal pixels, which means its even better than 4k which is a good deal.

8. Make sure to choose a SSD with 1-2TB, this is the most essential storage option

9. Lastly choose if you want to add a HDD to you're pc. Remember that it is not nessesary, but getting one can reduce the strain on your SSD, so I would recomend getting a small 6TB one
