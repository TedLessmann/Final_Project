# Parts that make up a computer

### Central Proccessinng Unit (CPU):

A CPU is the "brain" of a computer. It processes instructions from programs and performs calculations to execute tasks. The CPU retrieves data, interprets commands, and carries out actions, like running applications or managing hardware. The cores in a CPU refer to the individual processing units within the CPU that can independently execute tasks. It is rcomended to have at least 8 cores to efficiently run video editing programs on the pc.

### Random Access Memory (RAM):

It is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and programs that the CPU needs while performing tasks. However, RAM is volatile memory, meaning its contents are erased when the computer is turned off. The recomended amount of RAM to have is 32GB.

### Graphics Proccessing Unit(GPU):

A GPU is a specialized processor designed to handle computations related to rendering images, videos, and animations. It's optimized for parallel processing, making it highly efficient at handling large amounts of data simultaneously. Graphics cards are picked out based on their resolutions. The recomended amount of resolution for content creation is 4k, which stands for the approximate amount of horizontal pixels displayed.

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD):

A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) stores data magnetically on spinning disks called platters. A read/write head, mounted on an arm, moves across the spinning platters to read or write data. HDD's are the cheapest storage storage componet, while also offering the most storage. However, the HDD's are not as fast as the other storage option known as the Solid State Drive. You don't particularly need a HDD, but it is nice to have one just to keep memory off your SDD. 

### Solid State Drive (SSD):

A Solid-State Drive (SSD) stores data on flash memory chips instead of spinning disks. It has no moving parts, making it faster, more durable, and energy-efficient than traditional hard drives. Data is stored in memory cells that retain information even when the power is off. SSDs access data quickly, improving boot times, application loading, and overall system performance. The recomended amount of space to have on an SSD is 1 to 2 terrabytes.

### Mother Board

The motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer that connects and allows communication between all the essential components. It serves as the central hub for connecting the CPU, RAM, storage devices, GPU, and other peripherals like USB ports, sound cards, and network interfaces.
