A CPU is the "brain" of a computer. It processes instructions from programs and performs calculations to execute tasks. The CPU retrieves data, interprets commands, and carries out actions, like running applications or managing hardware. The cores in a CPU refer to the individual processing units within the CPU that can independently execute tasks.
